# Driver-Distraction-Dataset



Researchers often build their own datasets purely for their studies, many of which are never published. The dataset of StateFarm on Kaggle \cite{kaggle} was the first publicly available dataset used for competition purposes only. They defined ten distractions to be detected: safe driving, texting using right hand, talking on the phone using right hand, texting using left hand, talking on the phone using left hand, operating the radio, drinking, reaching behind, doing hair and makeup, and talking to a passenger. In \cite{AUC2018}, the authors created a new Distracted Driver dataset similar to the StateFarm's dataset (i.e., it is composed of the same ten distraction activities). A total of 44 volunteers from seven different countries participated in the creation of this dataset. However, the dataset is not balanced and not well annotated, as shown in fig. \ref{AUC_dataset}. Moreover, some drivers did not participate in the ten different activities. ![dataset](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36284282/131345876-b89ad3b3-67c9-4294-82ca-0c4e1c320492.png)
